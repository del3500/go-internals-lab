What makes TCP reliable?

- TCP is reliable because it overcomes the effects of packet loss or receiving packets out of order.
- Packet loss occurs when data fails to reach its destination -- typically because of data tranmission errors.
    - (such as wireless network interference) or network congestion.
- Network congestion happens when node attempts to send  more data over a network connection than the
  connection can handle, causing the nodes to discard the excess packets.
  - e.g., A node cannot send at a rate of 1 gigabit per second (GBPS) over a 10 megabit-per-second (Mbps) connection.
    The 10Mbps connection quickly become saturated, and nodes involved in the flow of the data drop the excess data.

Estabilishing a "Session" with the TCP Handshake

- A TCP connection uses a three-way handshake to introduce the client to the server and the server to the client.

                    |client             server|
                    |_________________________|
                    |                         |
               dial | ---------SYN--------->  | listen
                    |                         | accept
         established| <------SYN/ACK--------  |
                    |                         |
                    | ---------ACK--------->  | established
                    |_________________________|

- Before establishing a TCP connection, a server must listen for incoming connection.s
    - client refers to the dialing node, while server refers to the listening node.
    - TCP itself doesn't have a concept of client and server, but an established sesssion
      between two nodes, whereby one node reaches out to another node to establish the session.
